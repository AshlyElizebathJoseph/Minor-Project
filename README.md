# Minor-Project
# Real-time Face Detection with Text-to-Speech

## Overview
This project is a simple Python script that uses OpenCV and pyttsx3 to perform real-time face detection from a webcam feed. When a human face is detected, the system announces "Human is Detected" using text-to-speech.

## Features
- Utilizes the Haar Cascade Classifier for real-time face detection.
- Integrates the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality.
- Draws green rectangles around detected faces for visual feedback.
- User-friendly termination with the press of the 'q' key.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- pyttsx3

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection.git
   cd face-detection
